Description: Py-FileLock
        ===========
        
        This package contains a single module, which implements a platform independent
        file locking mechanism for Python.
        
        The lock includes a lock counter and is thread safe. This means, when locking
        the same lock object twice, it will not block.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	import filelock
        
        	lock = filelock.FileLock("my_lock_file")
        
        	with lock:
        		pass
        
        	try:
        		with lock.acquire(timeout = 10):
        			pass
        	except filelock.Timeout:
        		pass
